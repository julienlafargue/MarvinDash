## Theme
MarvinDash is a game made during an epitech jam.
This event is to carry out a project in two days on the time of a weekend on a given theme.
The theme this time was "super hero".

## Principle of the project

This games was made on the game maker game engine. The principle is simple: beat your opponent in 1v1.
However there is a further difficulty, it is necessary to press in rhythm to shoot and move faster.
